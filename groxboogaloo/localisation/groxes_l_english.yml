 giga_grox.2000.desc:0 "Preliminary scans of the Galactic Core prior to the discovery of its hyperlanes had predicted that it would be completely devoid of any intelligent lifeforms, as we failed to detect any traces of artificial radio-waves or other elements pointing towards the existence of an advanced civilization residing there.\n\nHowever, as the first few explorer probes began heading into the newly-revealed core, they started picking up faint yet persistent signals emanating from the region around the core itself. Originally assumed to be from the supermassive black hole at the very center of the galaxy, these signals only intensified in both strength and complexity before the explorer probes were finally shot down by what seemed to be some sort of automated defense system.\n\nBefore our scientists were even able to formulate theories as to how or why our scanners somehow missed an entire civilization residing within the galactic core, sensors across the galaxy picked up an extremely powerful subspace transmission coming from the edges of the central cluster.\n\nWhoever these mysterious beings residing within the core might be, they are now addressing the rest of the galaxy directly..."

 giga_grox.3001.desc:0 "The discovery of the Novian Arikhanate will certainly pose a threat to our nation. It will be necessary to form an agency dedicated to the study and collection of information related to the Novians. Every move they make that we know of will be catalogued and studied. There is great opportunity for scientific, cultural, and military gain by studying them considering how old their civilization is, a very rare and unique opportunity in this galaxy. Studying the Novians will be very beneficial in the long run, especially if they were to §Pattack§! us in the future, which is highly likely considering the data we have gathered from the limited communications we've had with them and their xenophobic nature."
 giga_grox.10001.name:0 "Novian Technology Study Complete"
 giga_grox.10001.desc:0 "From what our scientists and the limited data our probes have been able to gather Grox technology is highly advanced. However, similar to most precursor civilizations, it is not without its flaws. Most of their technology seems to be made for war as well as lasting for centuries with little maintenance, likely due to their civilization going into stasis for long periods for a currently unknown reason. Despite going to such lengths, it is showing the consequences of such little maintenance"
 giga_grox.10001.a:0 "Interesting"
 giga_grox.10002.name:0 "Novian Culture Investigation Complete"
 giga_grox.10002.desc:0 "From the limited data we could gather about the Arikhanate's society and culture it has been determined that they are a very unusual species. For an unknown reason their bodies use significantly different elements in the atmosphere which are not common on other habitable worlds. The Novians are a very rugged species because of this, being able to survive on many worlds that other species would consider barren. On these worlds they usually live subterranean colonies, in which they can control the climate and atmosphere of. However, if they were to set foot on a world that other species would typically consider habitable they would quickly die due to their unique biology.\n\nTheir culture has been impacted by this noticeably. Many parts of Novian society seem designed to prevent their population from becoming soft, so they can protect themselves from the 'primitive slaves' they see as a threat to their 'utopic' way of life. It is unknown what experience could cause a whole race to become so rampantly xenophobic and distrusting of outsiders.\n\nIt should also be known that the Novian Arikhanate is made up of a uniquely large number of slave races, having likely been gathered from previous excursions into the wider galaxy. Each of these races seems to be focused on serving a singular job within society. The arthropoid Sektians seem to be primarily focused on mining and farming. Thier current number is unknown but it is likely there are §Hsignificantly more§! of them than there are Novians due to their small stature and the sheer amount of labor needed to sustain the decadence of the Novian race. There are also a few other races which appear to serve in the same roles as the Sektians but they are seemingly the most dominant."

 giga_grox.10003.desc:0 "After the conclusion of our study of Novian engineering it has been concluded that some Novian ships make very limited use of higher dimensional engineering due to the sheer stress put on their constructs from their size. According to a few of our engineers their structures are figuratively 'held together by gigastructural duct tape, xeno based glue, and some hope and zealotry.' They appear to be meeting the energy demands of such advanced technology by §Sextracting energy from the hyperquasar at the center of the galaxy§!. If we were somehow able to get access to this, we would undoubtedly be able to throw much of their civilization into disarray, however such an attack would be very costly."

 giga_grox.10004.name:0 "The Ultimate Answer"
 giga_grox.10004.desc:0 "Since the Novians arrived on the galactic stage, they seem to have been focused on their 'Ultimate Answer.' Until now, we were unable to gather what this might be. After our thorough research into their empire, it has been concluded that this must be some type of hyperweapon, capable of potentially obliterating entire clusters of stars. The sheer scale of this construct will take considerable time and resources, being the crown jewel of any galactic hyperpower's military. From what our scientists have been able to gather recently they have came to one conclusion. This 'answer' appears to serve a religious purpose, as in the Novians' eyes it shows their faith's superiority and justness above all other. \n\nAside from the threat posed by such a device, building it will require the Grox to §Praid§! many empires to gather resources for it. Their position in the center of the galaxy makes this a significantly more threatening development."
