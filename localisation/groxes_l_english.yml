 giga_grox.2000.desc:0 "Preliminary scans of the Galactic Core prior to the discovery of its hyperlanes had predicted that it would be completely devoid of any intelligent lifeforms, as we failed to detect any traces of artificial radio-waves or other elements pointing towards the existence of an advanced civilization residing there.\n\nHowever, as the first few explorer probes began heading into the newly-revealed core, they started picking up faint yet persistent signals emanating from the region around the core itself. Originally assumed to be from the supermassive black hole at the very center of the galaxy, these signals only intensified in both strength and complexity before the explorer probes were finally shot down by what seemed to be some sort of automated defense system.\n\nBefore our scientists were even able to formulate theories as to how or why our scanners somehow missed an entire civilization residing within the galactic core, sensors across the galaxy picked up an extremely powerful subspace transmission coming from the edges of the central cluster.\n\nWhoever these mysterious beings residing within the core might be, they are now addressing the rest of the galaxy directly..."

 giga_grox.3001.desc:0 "The discovery of the Grox Empire will certainly pose a threat to our nation. It will be necessary to form an agency dedicated to the study and collection of information related to the Grox. Every move they make that we know of will be catalogued and studied. There is great opportunity for scientific, cultural, and military gain by studying them considering how old their civilization is. Studying the Grox will be very beneficial in the long run, especially if they were to §Pattack§! us in the future, which is highly likely considering the data we have gathered from the limited communications we've had with them and their xenophobic nature."
 giga_grox.10001.name:0 "Grox Technology Study Complete"
 giga_grox.10001.desc:0 "From what our scientists and the limited data our probes have been able to gather Grox technology is highly advanced. However, similar to most precursor civilizations, it is not without its flaws. Most of their technology seems to be made for war as well as lasting for centuries with little maintenance, likely due to their civilization going into stasis for long periods. Despite going to such lengths, it is showing the consequences of such little maintenance"

 giga_grox.10002.name:0 "Grox Culture Investigation Complete"
 giga_grox.10002.desc:0 "From the limited data we could gather about the Grox's society and culture it has been determined that they are a very unusual species. For an unknown reason their bodies use significantly different elements in the atmosphere which are not common on other habitable worlds. The Grox are a very rugged species because of this, being able to survive on many worlds that other species would consider barren. On these worlds they usually live subterranean colonies, in which they can control the climate and atmosphere of. However, if they were to set foot on a world that other species would typically consider habitable they would quickly die due to their unique biology.\n\nTheir culture has been impacted by this noticeably. Many parts of Grox society seem designed to prevent their population from becoming soft, so they can protect themselves from the 'primitives' they see as a threat to their 'utopic' way of life. It is unknown what experience could cause a whole race to become so rampantly xenophobic and distrusting of outsiders.\n\n"

They appear to be meeting the energy demands of such advanced technology by §Sextracting energy from the hyperquasar at the center of the galaxy§!. If we were somehow able to get access to this, we would undoubtedly be able to throw much of their civilization into disarray, however such an attack would be very costly."

After our thorough research into their empire, it has been concluded that this must be some type of hyperweapon, capable of potentially obliterating entire clusters of stars. The sheer scale of this construct will take considerable time and resources, being the crown jewel of any galactic hyperpower's military.\n\nAsside from the threat posed by such a device, building it will require the Grox to §Praid§! many empires to gather resources for it. Their position in the center of the galaxy makes this much more threatening"
